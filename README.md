## Projects

### Simple Linear Regression

This project involves building a simple linear regression model to predict a dependent variable based on a single independent variable. The project demonstrates the basic concepts of linear regression, including model training, evaluation, and visualization.

### Multivariate Linear Regression

In this project, I extend the concepts of linear regression to multiple independent variables. The multivariate linear regression model is used to predict a dependent variable based on several independent variables, showcasing the ability to handle more complex datasets.

### ARIMA Time Series Analysis

This project focuses on time series analysis using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. The project involves data preprocessing, model selection, parameter tuning, and forecasting future values based on historical time series data.

### Binary Classification

The binary classification project involves building and evaluating a model to classify data into one of two possible categories. Techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines are explored.

### Multiclass Classification

In this project, I tackle the problem of classifying data into multiple categories. Various algorithms, including multinomial logistic regression, random forests, and neural networks, are used to build and evaluate the classification models.

## Installation

To run the projects in this repository, you will need to have Python installed on your system. The required libraries and dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
